# My First Express NodeJS Server

## What is Express.js?
Server Side Code is complex! Just handling data in a previous example was difficult and that was just one type of data! 

- It allows us to install a package that will help us parse the data.
- It handles a lot of the nitty gritty detail of server side code
- It is a framework that has helper functions and tools & rules of how to structure your code

### Alternatives
- Vanilla NodeJS
  Just write everything yourself
- Adonis.js
  Laravel inspired.
- Koa
- Salis.js
- More!

Express is still the most popular and most used. It is highly flexible and extensible. Lots of 3rd Party Packages have been built for it.
